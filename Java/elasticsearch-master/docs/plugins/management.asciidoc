The core management plugins are:

link:/products/marvel[Marvel]::

Marvel is a management and monitoring product for Elasticsearch. Marvel
aggregates cluster wide statistics and events and offers a single interface to
view and analyze them. Marvel is free for development use but requires a
license to run in production.

This plugin will help you to check whether you can upgrade directly to
Elasticsearch version 2.x, or whether you need to make changes to your data
before doing so. It will run on Elasticsearch versions 0.90.x to 1.x.
