[[analysis-smartcn]]
=== Smart Chinese Analysis Plugin

The Smart Chinese Analysis plugin integrates Lucene's Smart Chinese analysis
module into elasticsearch.

It provides an analyzer for Chinese or mixed Chinese-English text. This
analyzer uses probabilistic knowledge to find the optimal word segmentation
for Simplified Chinese text. The text is first broken into sentences, then
each sentence is segmented into words.
