== Discovery Plugins

Discovery plugins extend Elasticsearch by adding new discovery mechanisms that
can be used instead of {ref}/modules-discovery-zen.html[Zen Discovery].

==== Core discovery plugins

The core discovery plugins are:

<<discovery-ec2,EC2 discovery>>::

The EC2 discovery plugin uses the https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java[AWS API] for unicast discovery.

<<discovery-azure,Azure discovery>>::

The Azure discovery plugin uses the Azure API for unicast discovery.

<<discovery-gce,GCE discovery>>::

The Google Compute Engine discovery plugin uses the GCE API for unicast discovery.

<<discovery-multicast,Multicast>>::

The multicast plugin sends multicast messages to discover other nodes in the cluster.
