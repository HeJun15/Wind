== Directory Layout

The directory layout of an installation is as follows:

[cols="<h,<,<m,<m",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Type | Description | Default Location | Setting
| home | Home of elasticsearch installation. | | path.home

| bin | Binary scripts including `elasticsearch` to start a node. | {path.home}/bin | | conf | Configuration files including `elasticsearch.yml` | {path.home}/config | path.conf

| data | The location of the data files of each index / shard allocated
on the node. Can hold multiple locations. | {path.home}/data| path.data

| logs | Log files location. | {path.home}/logs | path.logs

| plugins | Plugin files location. Each plugin will be contained in a subdirectory. | {path.home}/plugins | path.plugins

| repo | Shared file system repository locations. Can hold multiple locations. A file system repository can be placed in to any subdirectory of any directory specified here. d| Not configured | path.repo

| script | Location of script files. | {path.conf}/scripts | path.script

|=======================================================================

Multiple `data` paths may be specified, in order to spread data across
multiple disks or locations, but all of the files from a single shard will be
written to the same path. This can be configured as follows:

    ---------------------------------
    path.data: /mnt/first,/mnt/second
    ---------------------------------

 Or  in an array format:

    ----------------------------------------
    path.data: ["/mnt/first", "/mnt/second"]
    ----------------------------------------

TIP:  To stripe shards across multiple disks, please use a RAID driver
instead.
