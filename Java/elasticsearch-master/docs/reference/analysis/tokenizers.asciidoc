== Tokenizers

Tokenizers are used to break a string down into a stream of terms
or tokens. A simple tokenizer might split the string up into terms 
wherever it encounters whitespace or punctuation.

Elasticsearch has a number of built in tokenizers which can be
used to build <<analysis-custom-analyzer,custom analyzers>>.
