=== Classic Tokenizer

A tokenizer of type `classic` providing grammar based tokenizer that is
a good tokenizer for English language documents. This tokenizer has 
heuristics for special treatment of acronyms, company names, email addresses,
and internet host names. However, these rules don't always work, and 
the tokenizer doesn't work well for most languages other than English.

The following are settings that can be set for a `classic` tokenizer
type:
