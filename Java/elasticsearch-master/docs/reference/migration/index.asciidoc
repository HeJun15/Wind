This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating
your application from one version of Elasticsearch to another.

As a general rule:

* Migration between major versions -- e.g. `1.x` to `2.x` --
  requires a <<restart-upgrade,full cluster restart>>.

* Migration between minor versions -- e.g. `1.x` to `1.y` -- can be
  performed by <<rolling-upgrades,upgrading one node at a time>>.

See <<setup-upgrade>> for more info.
