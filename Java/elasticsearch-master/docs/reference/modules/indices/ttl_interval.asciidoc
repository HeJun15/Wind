once they have expired.  How and how often they are deleted is controlled by
the following dynamic cluster settings:

`indices.ttl.interval`::

    How often the deletion process runs.  Defaults to `60s`.

`indices.ttl.bulk_size`::

    The deletions are processed with a <<docs-bulk,bulk request>>.
    The number of deletions processed can be configured with
    this settings. Defaults to `10000`.
