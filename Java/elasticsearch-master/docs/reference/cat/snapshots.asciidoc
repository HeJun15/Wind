== cat snapshots

The `snapshots` command shows all snapshots that belong to a specific repository.
To find a list of available repositories to query, the command `/_cat/repositories` can be used.
Querying the snapshots of a repository named `repo1` then looks as follows.

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
% curl 'localhost:9200/_cat/snapshots/repo1?v'

Each snapshot contains information about when it was started and stopped.
Start and stop timestamps are available in two formats.
The `HH:MM:SS` output is simply for quick human consumption.
The epoch time retains more information, including date, and is machine sortable if the snapshot process spans days.
