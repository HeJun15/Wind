=== GeoShape Query

Filter documents indexed using the `geo_shape` type.

Requires the <<geo-shape,`geo_shape` Mapping>>.

The `geo_shape` query uses the same grid square representation as the
geo_shape mapping to find documents that have a shape that intersects
with the query shape. It will also use the same PrefixTree configuration
as defined for the field mapping.

The query supports two ways of defining the query shape, either by
providing a whole shape definition, or by referencing the name of a shape
pre-indexed in another index. Both formats are defined below with
examples.

==== Inline Shape Definition

Similar to the `geo_shape` type, the `geo_shape` Filter uses
http://www.geojson.org[GeoJSON] to represent shapes.

Given a document that looks like this:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "name": "Wind & Wetter, Berlin, Germany",
    "location": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [13.400544, 52.530286]
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

The following query will find the point using the Elasticsearch's
`envelope` GeoJSON extension:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "query":{
        "bool": {
            "must": {
                "match_all": {}
            },
            "filter": {
                "geo_shape": {
                    "location": {
                        "shape": {
                            "type": "envelope",
                            "coordinates" : [[13.0, 53.0], [14.0, 52.0]]
                        },
                        "relation": "within"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

==== Pre-Indexed Shape

The Query also supports using a shape which has already been indexed in
another index and/or index type. This is particularly useful for when
you have a pre-defined list of shapes which are useful to your
application and you want to reference this using a logical name (for
example 'New Zealand') rather than having to provide their coordinates
each time. In this situation it is only necessary to provide:

* `id` - The ID of the document that containing the pre-indexed shape.
* `index` - Name of the index where the pre-indexed shape is. Defaults
to 'shapes'.
* `type` - Index type where the pre-indexed shape is.
* `path` - The field specified as path containing the pre-indexed shape.
Defaults to 'shape'.

The following is an example of using the Filter with a pre-indexed
shape:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "bool": {
        "must": {
            "match_all": {}
        },
        "filter": {
            "geo_shape": {
                "location": {
                    "indexed_shape": {
                        "id": "DEU",
                        "type": "countries",
                        "index": "shapes",
                        "path": "location"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

==== Spatial Relations

The Query supports the following spatial relations:

* `INTERSECTS` - (default) Return all documents whose `geo_shape` field
intersects the query geometry.
* `DISJOINT` - Return all documents whose `geo_shape` field
has nothing in common with the query geometry.
* `WITHIN` - Return all documents whose `geo_shape` field
is within the query geometry.
* `CONTAINS` - Return all documents whose `geo_shape` field
contains the query geometry.
