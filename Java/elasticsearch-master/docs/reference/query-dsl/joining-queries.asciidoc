== Joining queries

Performing full SQL-style joins in a distributed system like Elasticsearch is
prohibitively expensive.  Instead, Elasticsearch offers two forms of join
which are designed to scale horizontally.

<<query-dsl-nested-query,`nested` query>>::

Documents may contains fields of type <<nested,`nested`>>. These
fields are used to index arrays of objects, where each object can be queried
(with the `nested` query) as an independent document.

<<query-dsl-has-child-query,`has_child`>> and <<query-dsl-has-parent-query,`has_parent`>> queries::

A <<mapping-parent-field,parent-child relationship>> can exist between two
document types within a single index. The `has_child` query returns parent
documents whose child documents match the specified query, while the
`has_parent` query returns child documents whose parent document matches the
specified query.

Also see the <<query-dsl-terms-lookup,terms-lookup mechanism>> in the `terms`
query, which allows you to build a `terms` query from values contained in
another document.
