[[string]]
=== String datatype

Fields of type `string` accept text values.  Strings may be sub-divided into:

Full text::
+
--

Full text values, like the body of an email, are typically used for text based
relevance searches, such as: _Find the most relevant documents that match a
query for "quick brown fox"_.

These fields are `analyzed`, that is they are passed through an
<<analysis,analyzer>> to convert the string into a list of individual terms
before being indexed. The analysis process allows Elasticsearch to search for
individual words _within_  each full text field.  Full text fields are not
used for sorting and seldom used for aggregations (although the
<<search-aggregations-bucket-significantterms-aggregation,significant terms aggregation>> is a notable exception).

--

Keywords::

Keywords are exact values like email addresses, hostnames, status codes, or
tags.  They are typically used for filtering (_Find me all blog posts where
++status++ is ++published++_), for sorting, and for aggregations. Keyword
fields are `not_analyzed`.  Instead, the exact string value is added to the
index as a single term.

Below is an example of a mapping for a full text (`analyzed`) and a keyword
(`not_analyzed`) string field:

[source,js]
--------------------------------
PUT my_index
{
  "mappings": {
    "my_type": {
      "properties": {
        "full_name": { <1>
          "type":  "string"
        },
        "status": {
          "type":  "string", <2>
          "index": "not_analyzed"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------
// AUTOSENSE
<1> The `full_name` field is an `analyzed` full text field -- `index:analyzed` is the default.
<2> The `status` field is a `not_analyzed` keyword field.

Sometimes it is useful to have both a full text (`analyzed`) and a keyword
(`not_analyzed`) version of the same field: one for full text search and the
other for aggregations and sorting. This can be achieved with
<<multi-fields,multi-fields>>.


[[string-params]]
==== Parameters for string fields

The following parameters are accepted by `string` fields:

[horizontal]

<<analyzer,`analyzer`>>::

    The <<analysis,analyzer>> which should be used for
    <<mapping-index,`analyzed`>> string fields, both at index-time and at
    search-time (unless overridden by the  <<search-analyzer,`search_analyzer`>>).
    Defaults to the default index analyzer, or the
    <<analysis-standard-analyzer,`standard` analyzer>>.

<<index-boost,`boost`>>::

    Field-level index time boosting. Accepts a floating point number, defaults
    to `1.0`.

<<doc-values,`doc_values`>>::

    Should the field be stored on disk in a column-stride fashion, so that it
    can later be used for sorting, aggregations, or scripting? Accepts `true`
    or `false`. Defaults to `true` for `not_analyzed` fields. Analyzed fields
    do not support doc values.

<<fielddata,`fielddata`>>::

    Can the field use in-memory fielddata for sorting, aggregations,
    or scripting? Accepts `disabled` or `paged_bytes` (default).
    Not analyzed fields will use <<doc-values,doc values>> in preference
    to fielddata.

<<multi-fields,`fields`>>::

    Multi-fields allow the same string value to be indexed in multiple ways for
    different purposes, such as one field for search and a multi-field for
    sorting and aggregations, or the same string value analyzed by different
    analyzers.

<<ignore-above,`ignore_above`>>::

    Do not index or analyze any string longer than this value.  Defaults to `0` (disabled).

<<include-in-all,`include_in_all`>>::

    Whether or not the field value should be included in the
    <<mapping-all-field,`_all`>> field? Accepts `true` or `false`.  Defaults
    to `false` if <<mapping-index,`index`>> is set to `no`, or if a parent
    <<object,`object`>> field sets `include_in_all` to `false`.
    Otherwise defaults to `true`.

<<mapping-index,`index`>>::

    Should the field be searchable? Accepts `analyzed` (default, treat as full-text field),
    `not_analyzed` (treat as keyword field) and `no`.

<<index-options,`index_options`>>::

    What information should be stored in the index, for search and highlighting purposes.
    Defaults to `positions` for <<mapping-index,`analyzed`>> fields, and to `docs` for
    `not_analyzed` fields.


<<norms,`norms`>>::
+
--

Whether field-length should be taken into account when scoring queries.
Defaults depend on the <<mapping-index,`index`>> setting:

* `analyzed` fields default to `{ "enabled": true, "loading": "lazy" }`.
* `not_analyzed` fields default to `{ "enabled": false }`.
--

<<null-value,`null_value`>>::

    Accepts a string value which is substituted for any explicit `null`
    values.  Defaults to `null`, which means the field is treated as missing.
    If the field is `analyzed`, the `null_value` will also be analyzed.

<<position-increment-gap,`position_increment_gap`>>::

    The number of fake term positions which should be inserted between
    each element of an array of strings. Defaults to 0.
    The number of fake term position which should be inserted between each
    element of an array of strings. Defaults to the position_increment_gap
    configured on the analyzer which defaults to 100. 100 was chosen because it
    prevents phrase queries with reasonably large slops (less than 100) from
    matching terms across field values.

<<mapping-store,`store`>>::

    Whether the field value should be stored and retrievable separately from
    the <<mapping-source-field,`_source`>> field. Accepts `true` or `false`
    (default).

<<search-analyzer,`search_analyzer`>>::

    The <<analyzer,`analyzer`>> that should be used at search time on
    <<mapping-index,`analyzed`>> fields. Defaults to the `analyzer` setting.

<<similarity,`similarity`>>::

    Which scoring algorithm or _similarity_ should be used. Defaults
    to `default`, which uses TF/IDF.

<<term-vector,`term_vector`>>::

    Whether term vectors should be stored for an <<mapping-index,`analyzed`>>
    field. Defaults to `no`.
