=== Search Slow Log

Shard level slow search log allows to log slow search (query and fetch
phases) into a dedicated log file.

Thresholds can be set for both the query phase of the execution, and
fetch phase, here is a sample:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.warn: 10s
index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.info: 5s
index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.debug: 2s
index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.trace: 500ms

index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.warn: 1s
index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.info: 800ms
index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.debug: 500ms
index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.trace: 200ms
--------------------------------------------------

All of the above settings are _dynamic_ and can be set per-index.

By default, none are enabled (set to `-1`). Levels (`warn`, `info`,
`debug`, `trace`) allow to control under which logging level the log
will be logged. Not all are required to be configured (for example, only
`warn` threshold can be set). The benefit of several levels is the
ability to quickly "grep" for specific thresholds breached.

The logging is done on the shard level scope, meaning the execution of a
search request within a specific shard. It does not encompass the whole
search request, which can be broadcast to several shards in order to
execute. Some of the benefits of shard level logging is the association
of the actual execution on the specific machine, compared with request
level.

The logging file is configured by default using the following
configuration (found in `logging.yml`):

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
index_search_slow_log_file:
  type: dailyRollingFile
  file: ${path.logs}/${cluster.name}_index_search_slowlog.log
  datePattern: "'.'yyyy-MM-dd"
  layout:
    type: pattern
    conversionPattern: "[%d{ISO8601}][%-5p][%-25c] %m%n"
--------------------------------------------------

[[index-slow-log]]
=== Index Slow log

The indexing slow log, similar in functionality to the search slow
log. The log file is ends with `_index_indexing_slowlog.log`. Log and
the thresholds are configured in the elasticsearch.yml file in the same
way as the search slowlog. Index slowlog sample:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.warn: 10s
index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.info: 5s
index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.debug: 2s
index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.trace: 500ms
index.indexing.slowlog.level: info
index.indexing.slowlog.source: 1000
--------------------------------------------------

All of the above settings are _dynamic_ and can be set per-index.

By default Elasticsearch will log the first 1000 characters of the _source in
the slowlog. You can change that with `index.indexing.slowlog.source`. Setting
it to `false` or `0` will skip logging the source entirely an setting it to
`true` will log the entire source regardless of size.

The index slow log file is configured by default in the `logging.yml`
file:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
index_indexing_slow_log_file:
    type: dailyRollingFile
    file: ${path.logs}/${cluster.name}_index_indexing_slowlog.log
    datePattern: "'.'yyyy-MM-dd"
    layout:
      type: pattern
      conversionPattern: "[%d{ISO8601}][%-5p][%-25c] %m%n"
--------------------------------------------------
