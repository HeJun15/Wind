=== Date Range Aggregation

A range aggregation that is dedicated for date values. The main difference between this aggregation and the normal <<search-aggregations-bucket-range-aggregation,range>> aggregation is that the `from` and `to` values can be expressed in <<date-math,Date Math>> expressions, and it is also possible to specify a date format by which the `from` and `to` response fields will be returned.
Note that this aggregation includes the `from` value and excludes the `to` value for each range.

Example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "aggs": {
        "range": {
            "date_range": {
                "field": "date",
                "format": "MM-yyy",
                "ranges": [
                    { "to": "now-10M/M" }, <1>
                    { "from": "now-10M/M" } <2>
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
<1> < now minus 10 months, rounded down to the start of the month.
<2> >= now minus 10 months, rounded down to the start of the month.

In the example above, we created two range buckets, the first will "bucket" all documents dated prior to 10 months ago and
the second will "bucket" all documents dated since 10 months ago

Response:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    ...

    "aggregations": {
        "range": {
            "buckets": [
                {
                    "to": 1.3437792E+12,
                    "to_as_string": "08-2012",
                    "doc_count": 7
                },
                {
                    "from": 1.3437792E+12,
                    "from_as_string": "08-2012",
                    "doc_count": 2
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}

The count of pattern letters determine the format.

Text:: If the number of pattern letters is 4 or more, the full form is used; otherwise a short or abbreviated form is used if available.

Number:: The minimum number of digits. Shorter numbers are zero-padded to this amount.

Year:: Numeric presentation for year and weekyear fields are handled specially. For example, if the count of 'y' is 2, the year will be displayed as the zero-based year of the century, which is two digits.

Month:: 3 or over, use text, otherwise use number.

Zone:: 'Z' outputs offset without a colon, 'ZZ' outputs the offset with a colon, 'ZZZ' or more outputs the zone id.

Zone names:: Time zone names ('z') cannot be parsed.

Any characters in the pattern that are not in the ranges of ['a'..'z'] and ['A'..'Z'] will be treated as quoted text. For instance, characters like ':', '.', ' ', '#' and '?' will appear in the resulting time text even they are not embraced within single quotes.
