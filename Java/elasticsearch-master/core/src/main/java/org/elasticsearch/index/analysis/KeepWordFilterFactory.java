/**
 * A {@link TokenFilterFactory} for {@link KeepWordFilter}. This filter only
 * keep tokens that are contained in the term set configured via
 * {@value #KEEP_WORDS_KEY} setting. This filter acts like an inverse stop
 * filter.
 * <p>
 * Configuration options:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@value #KEEP_WORDS_KEY} the array of words / tokens to keep.</li>
 * <li>{@value #KEEP_WORDS_PATH_KEY} an reference to a file containing the words
 * / tokens to keep. Note: this is an alternative to {@value #KEEP_WORDS_KEY} if
 * both are set an exception will be thrown.</li>
 * <li>{@value #ENABLE_POS_INC_KEY} <code>true</code> iff the filter should
 * maintain position increments for dropped tokens. The default is
 * <code>true</code>.</li>
 * <li>{@value #KEEP_WORDS_CASE_KEY} to use case sensitive keep words. The
 * default is <code>false</code> which corresponds to case-sensitive.</li>
 * </ul>
