/**
 * Index / Search Warmer Administrative Actions
 * <p>
 *     Index warming allows to run registered search requests to warm up the index before it is available for search.
 *     With the near real time aspect of search, cold data (segments) will be warmed up before they become available for
 *     search. This includes things such as the query cache, filesystem cache, and loading field data for fields.
 * </p>
 *
 * See the reference guide for more detailed information about the Indices / Search Warmer
