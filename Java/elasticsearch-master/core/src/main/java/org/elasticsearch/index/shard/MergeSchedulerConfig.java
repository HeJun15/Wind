/**
 * The merge scheduler (<code>ConcurrentMergeScheduler</code>) controls the execution of
 * merge operations once they are needed (according to the merge policy).  Merges
 * run in separate threads, and when the maximum number of threads is reached,
 * further merges will wait until a merge thread becomes available.
 * 
 * <p>The merge scheduler supports the following <b>dynamic</b> settings:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> <code>index.merge.scheduler.max_thread_count</code>:
 * 
 *     The maximum number of threads that may be merging at once. Defaults to
 *     <code>Math.max(1, Math.min(4, Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() / 2))</code>
 *     which works well for a good solid-state-disk (SSD).  If your index is on
 *     spinning platter drives instead, decrease this to 1.
 * 
 * <li><code>index.merge.scheduler.auto_throttle</code>:
 * 
 *     If this is true (the default), then the merge scheduler will rate-limit IO
 *     (writes) for merges to an adaptive value depending on how many merges are
 *     requested over time.  An application with a low indexing rate that
 *     unluckily suddenly requires a large merge will see that merge aggressively
 *     throttled, while an application doing heavy indexing will see the throttle
 *     move higher to allow merges to keep up with ongoing indexing.
 * </ul>
