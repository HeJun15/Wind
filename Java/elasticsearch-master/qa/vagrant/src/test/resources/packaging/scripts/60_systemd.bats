# This file is used to test the elasticsearch Systemd setup.

# WARNING: This testing file must be executed as root and can
# dramatically change your system. It removes the 'elasticsearch'
# user/group and also many directories. Do not execute this file
# unless you know exactly what you are doing.

# The test case can be executed with the Bash Automated
# Testing System tool available at https://github.com/sstephenson/bats
